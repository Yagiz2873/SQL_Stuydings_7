# SQL_Stuydings_7
As you can see from the file, I have continued my SQL journey by learning some CRUD operations and views
I have learned to create and drop views. I have learned to us information schemas and its properties and attributes
I have learned to use CRUD DDL and DML operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, SELECT INTO, UPDATE-SET, DROP TABLE, DROP COLUMN,CREATE DATABASE, INSERT INTO/VALUES) as well as new keywords and functions (for example DEFAULT, DATEPART(), CASE/WHEN THEN/END AS,DATEDIFF, NTILE() OVER(), CONVERT())
